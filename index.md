I am a doctoral student at Probabilistic Machine Learning group at Aalto Univeristy. My research is focused on bayesian deep learning and developing scalable learning algorithms for practical applications in various domains.  

My prime areas of interest are:

- Bayesian Deep Learning
- Generative models
- Uncertainty in learning models

**Quote**: May all your minima be global.
